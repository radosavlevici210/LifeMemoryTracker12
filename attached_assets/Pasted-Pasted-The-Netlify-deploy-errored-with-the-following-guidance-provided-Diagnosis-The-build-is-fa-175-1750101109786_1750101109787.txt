The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing due to an error related to Python version 3.11.

**Solution:**
1. **Python Version Mismatch:** The error occurs because the required Python version `3.11` is not available.
2. **Solution:** 
   - Verify that Python version `3.11` is supported in the project configuration.
   - If `3.11` is required, check if it's available in the project's build settings or documentation.
   - If `3.11` is not explicitly necessary, consider downgrading to a supported Python version. 
   - Check and update the Python version compatibility in the project's requirements or configuration files.

For Node.js or JavaScript version mismatches on Netlify, you can refer to the [documentation for changing Node versions](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript).
